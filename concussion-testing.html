      <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
      <p>This project is currently under active development. I'm working on building a new, cost-effective design for reaction time testing to improve concussion baseline assessments.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Status:</strong> In Development</p>
      <p><strong>Expected Completion:</strong> Done within this month!</p>

      <p>I am essentially in the process of building a light board for reaction time testing, but as cheap and accurate as possible to eventually be used by
        all athletes in the Gettysburg College athletic training room!</p>
