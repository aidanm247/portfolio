  <h1>Sports Medicine</h1>
  <p>My interests are in the intersection of technology and human health</p>

  <h2>Specific Areas of Interest (as of now) </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Biomechanics - Understanding how the body moves and functions during athletic performance</li>
      <p>I really like the work that <a href="https://www.p3.md/" target="_blank">P3</a> does with data analytics, biomechanics, and athletic performance.</p>
    <li>Sports Technology - Exploring the use of technology to enhance athletic performance and training</li>
    <li>Injury Prevention - Developing strategies and technologies to prevent sports-related injuries</li>
    <li>Tendon Health - Research and applications focused on tendon function, recovery, and optimization</li>
      <p>I have a personal interest in understanding and improving tendon health, especially given my own experiences with injuries. The UC Davis Muscle and Tendon labs are doing some really cool stuff</p>
    <li>Sports Rehabilitation - Engineering new devices and technologies to aid recovery from sports injuries in athletes</li>
         <p> I am working on building some concussion baseline testing and rehab devices</p>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Sports Medicine?</h2>
  <p>
    I am a current college basketball player with a extensive history of injuries, specifically tendon related.
