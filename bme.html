  <p>My work at the intersection of signal processing and physiological monitoring</p>

  <h2>Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) Internship</h2>
  <p>
    I have contributed to helping build an app focused on mapping remote photoplethysmography recordings 
    to the body's inflammatory response. This work explores how non-contact optical sensors 
    can detect subtle changes in blood flow patterns that correlate with inflammatory markers 
    in the body.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Areas of Focus</h2>
  <ul class="sports-medicine">
    <li>Signal processing techniques for rPPG data extraction and analysis</li>
    <li>Correlation analysis between optical measurements and inflammatory biomarkers</li>
    <li>Development of algorithms for real-time physiological monitoring</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    This research has potential applications in non-invasive health monitoring, early 
    detection of inflammatory conditions, and remote patient care systems. The ability 
    to assess inflammatory response without direct contact opens new possibilities for 
    continuous health monitoring in various settings.
